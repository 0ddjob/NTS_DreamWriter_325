# NTS_DreamWriter_325
The NTS DreamWriter 325 (from Canadian company NTS Computer Systems) is based on the Amstrad NC100 - superficially (apart from colours) they look identical. <br>

Most of the hardware is the same (i.e. same LCD panel, keyboard, etc.) but the major difference is their CPU.<br>

The Amstrad NC100 uses a Z80 and the 325 uses a V20 (NEC's enhanced 8088). <br>

Thus, from a firmware perspective they are not compatible (i.e. ROM).  They do both have a dialect of BASIC installed and appear to have similar organiser functionality.<br>

## [ROMs](ROM)
There are three ROM versions that I know of:
- Vers. 1.02 that is available with MAME
- Vers. 1.03 that shipped with my machine has a Typing Tutor but no BASIC implementation
- Vers. 2.0 upgrade (thanks to MrWaalkman) does include BASIC (based on IBM BASIC rather than BBC BASIC like on the NC100).

## [Manual](https://archive.org/details/dreamwriter-325-instruction-manual)
This is the manual for the Vers. 2.0 ROM (again, thanks to MrWaalkman).<br>
