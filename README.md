# NTS_DreamWriter_325
The NTS DreamWriter 325 (from Canadian company NTS Computer Systems) is based on the Amstrad NC100 - superficially (apart from colours) they look identical. <br>

Most of the hardware is the same (i.e. same LCD panel, keyboard, etc.) but the major difference is their CPU.<br>

The Amstrad NC100 uses a Z80 and the 325 uses a V20 (NEC's enhanced 8088). <br>

Thus, from a firmware perspective they are not compatible (i.e. ROM).  They do both have a dialect of BASIC installed and appear to have similar organiser functionality.<br>
